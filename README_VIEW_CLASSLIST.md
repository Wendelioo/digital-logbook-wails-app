## 📊 Mock Data Available

## 📚 More Information

- **`CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`** - What was changed
- **`VIEW_CLASSLIST_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed guide
- **`MOCK_DATA_SETUP.md`** - Mock data details

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **You MUST rebuild** the app to see changes
2. The **Add Student** and **Save Changes** buttons show alerts (placeholders for future implementation)
3. **Remove Student** works locally but doesn't persist (no database)
4. All data is **mock data** - works without database!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
- Make sure you rebuilt: `./rebuild.sh`

**Don't have Go/Wails?**
- Install Go: `sudo apt install golang-go`
- Or Wails: https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation

**Can't login?**
- Username: `teacher` (lowercase)
- Password: `teacher123`
- Make sure "Teacher" is selected

**Changes not showing?**

- Try: `pkill digital-logbook` then rebuild
