# Photo Upload Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

The photo upload feature was failing with the error message:
> "Failed to update photo. Make sure you are connected to the database."

## Root Cause

The issue was **NOT** a database connection problem. The actual problem was:

1. **Column Size Limitation**: The `profile_photo` columns in all user tables (`admins`, `teachers`, `students`, `working_students`) were defined as `VARCHAR(255)`, which can only hold 255 characters.

2. **Large Data URLs**: When users upload photos, the frontend converts them to base64-encoded data URLs (e.g., `data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQ...`). These data URLs are typically **thousands of characters long** for even small images, far exceeding the 255-character limit.

3. **Missing Photo Retrieval**: The `Login` function wasn't fetching the `profile_photo` field from the database, so even if a photo was saved, it wouldn't be displayed when users logged back in.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Column Size Fix
- **Changed**: `profile_photo` column type from `VARCHAR(255)` to `MEDIUMTEXT`
- **Capacity**: Can now hold up to 16,777,215 characters (~16 MB)
- **Location**: All user tables (admins, teachers, students, working_students)
- **Migration File**: `database/migration_fix_profile_photo_size.sql`

### 2. Updated Go Code (app.go)
- **Modified**: `Login` function to fetch `profile_photo` from database
- **Added**: Photo URL to all user detail queries
- **Result**: Profile photos now persist across login sessions

### 3. Updated Schema File
- **File**: `database/schema.sql`
- **Change**: Updated all `profile_photo` columns to `MEDIUMTEXT`
- **Purpose**: Ensures future database setups have the correct column type

## Migration Files Created

1. **migration_add_profile_photo.sql** ✓ Applied
   - Adds `profile_photo` columns if they don't exist
   
2. **migration_fix_profile_photo_size.sql** ✓ Applied
   - Changes column type from VARCHAR(255) to MEDIUMTEXT

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart the Application**
   ```bash
   # If you have the executable
   ./build/bin/digital-logbook-wails-app-dev-linux-amd64
   
   # Or rebuild and run
   wails dev
   ```

2. **Test Photo Upload**
   - Log in as any user (student, teacher, admin, or working student)
   - Click on your profile avatar in the top right
   - Click "Account Settings"
   - Click "Change Photo" and select an image
   - Click "Save Photo"
   - You should see: "Photo updated successfully!"

3. **Verify Persistence**
   - Log out
   - Log back in
   - Your profile photo should still be displayed

## Technical Details

### Database Changes Applied

```sql
-- Column type changed from:
profile_photo VARCHAR(255)

-- To:
profile_photo MEDIUMTEXT

-- In tables:
- admins
- teachers  
- students
- working_students
```

### Code Changes

**Before**:
```sql
SELECT first_name, middle_name, last_name, gender, student_id, year_level, section 
FROM students WHERE user_id = ?
```

**After**:
```sql
SELECT first_name, middle_name, last_name, gender, student_id, year_level, section, profile_photo 
FROM students WHERE user_id = ?
```

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `app.go` - Updated Login function to fetch profile photos
2. ✅ `database/schema.sql` - Updated schema for future deployments
3. ✅ `database/migration_add_profile_photo.sql` - Migration script (applied)
4. ✅ `database/migration_fix_profile_photo_size.sql` - Migration script (applied)

## Status

✅ **FIXED** - Photo upload now works correctly!

The database has been migrated and the code has been updated. Simply restart your application and the photo upload feature should work without any errors.
