# Fix for Blank White Screen After Login

## The Problem
You're seeing a blank white screen after logging in as a teacher. This is because the app is running an old version that doesn't have the updated backend functions.

## Quick Fix (Temporary)

I've created a simplified version of the Teacher Dashboard that should work. Try this:

### Step 1: Refresh Your Browser
1. Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (hard refresh)
2. Or close and reopen the app

### Step 2: Login Again
- Username: `teacher`
- Password: `teacher123`
- Select "Teacher" from dropdown

### Step 3: You Should Now See
- A working dashboard with:
  - Welcome message
  - Three stat cards
  - Your subjects (IT101, IT102)
  - Quick action buttons

## Permanent Fix

To get the full feature (View Class List), you need to rebuild the app with Go installed:

### Option 1: Install Go (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Go
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go

# Rebuild the app
cd /home/wendel/Desktop/digital-logbook-wails-app
go build -o build/bin/digital-logbook-wails-app-dev-linux-amd64

# Restart the app
./build/bin/digital-logbook-wails-app-dev-linux-amd64
```

### Option 2: Use the Rebuild Script
```bash
cd /home/wendel/Desktop/digital-logbook-wails-app
./rebuild.sh
```

## What Happened?

The blank screen was caused by:
1. The app was running an old version
2. The frontend was trying to call new backend functions that didn't exist
3. This caused JavaScript errors, resulting in a blank screen

## Test Steps

1. **Try the simple version first** (should work now)
2. **If that works**, you know the issue is with the backend
3. **Install Go and rebuild** to get the full features

## What You Should See Now

✅ **Simple Dashboard:**
- Welcome message
- My Subjects: 2 (IT101, IT102)
- Today's Attendance: 0
- Present Today: 0
- Subject cards showing IT101 and IT102

❌ **Missing (until you rebuild):**
- Class Lists table
- View Class List detail page
- Full attendance management

## If Still Blank

1. **Check browser console** (F12 → Console)
2. **Try admin login** instead:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. **Clear browser cache completely**

## Next Steps

Once you have Go installed and can rebuild:
1. The simple version will be replaced with the full version
2. You'll get the complete "View Class List" feature
3. All the mock data and functionality will work

The simple version is just a temporary fix to get you past the blank screen!
