### 4. Data Flow

1. **User Registration**:

   - System determines authentication method
   - Successful login records to login_logs table
   - User session created

3. **View Logs**:
   - Admin can filter by user type
   - Search across multiple fields
   - Real-time display of login/logout activities

4. **Equipment Reports**:
   - Students submit reports with PC number, time, and condition
   - Admin can view and search all reports
   - Reports include timestamp and equipment condition

## Testing Status

✅ Backend compiles successfully (Go)
✅ Frontend builds without errors (TypeScript/React)
✅ All models and API methods implemented
✅ All UI components implemented
✅ Gender field added to all registration forms
✅ PC Number tracking in logs
✅ Equipment reports with detailed information

## How to Run

### Development Mode
```bash
wails dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
wails build
```

### Requirements
- Go 1.23+
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL database running (or use mock data mode in `config.go`)

## Default Credentials

If using mock data mode, default credentials are:
- Admin: username: `admin`, password: `admin123`
- Instructor: username: `instructor1`, password: `inst123`
- Student: username: `2025-1234`, password: `2025-1234`

## Notes

1. All user types except Admin have default passwords set to their ID (Student ID or Employee ID)
2. Gender field is required for all user registrations
3. The admin profile dropdown includes photo upload functionality
4. Login logs automatically record PC number, user type, and timestamps
5. Equipment reports include all required fields as specified
6. User management includes robust filtering, searching, and pagination
7. Database migrations handled automatically for existing installations

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
